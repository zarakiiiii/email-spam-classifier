🚀 Built an Email Spam Classifier + Chrome Extension! 🚀

Excited to share my latest project—a Machine Learning-powered Email Spam Classifier 🔍📧. I trained a model to detect spam emails and even built a Chrome extension to make it super easy to use!

🔹 What it does:
✅ Uses Machine Learning & TF-IDF to analyze emails
✅ Classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam in real-time
✅ Integrated into a Chrome Extension for seamless usability

🔹 Tech Stack:
🔹 Python (Flask, Scikit-Learn)
🔹 Machine Learning (Logistic Regression/SVM/etc.)
🔹 Chrome Extension (JavaScript)

This project gave me hands-on experience in feature extraction, model deployment, and integrating ML with real-world applications.
